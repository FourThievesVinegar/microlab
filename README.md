This is the software component for controlling and monitoring the Four Thieves Vinegar Collective's Apothecary Microlab hardware. It's built for Raspberry Pi using Python 3.6 for the API and controller service layer and JavaScript for the UI.

This is beta software and is under active development.

## Installation

It is advised you're using a virtualenv. Then install all the deps in `requirements.txt`:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then you need to install RabbitMQ. If you're on a Debian/Ubuntu-based system you can
run `./rabbitmq_install.sh`. But make sure to fill in `PASS` in `./rabbitmq_install.sh`
and `AMPQ_PASS` in `microlab/settings.py`. If you're not on a Debian/Ubuntu system
you'll need to follow: https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html

## Running the Software

First you need to run the Celery task mamager, from the root microlab directory:

    celery -A microlab.tasks worker --loglevel INFO

From the microlab root directory, just run the following command to run the Flask microservice layer.

    FLASK_DEBUG=true ./run.py

The API will be running at `localhost:5000`.
